Prompt for Replit – Warubi Ecosystem App (with real partners & connections)
You are my coding assistant inside a Replit project for Warubi Sports. Before we change any code, I want you to fully understand how the Warubi ecosystem and its key partners fit together.
1. Warubi Sports – the central hub
Warubi Sports is a full-service soccer management company that guides players and coaches through youth, college, and professional stages. It describes itself as a global alliance of agencies, coaches, clubs, colleges, and federations and reports having supported 1,000+ players and coaches with scholarships, licenses, and contracts.
Warubi Sports
Think of Warubi as the hub that coordinates multiple pathways and partners, not just a single agency.
2. AthletesUSA – the integrated college pathway branch
AthletesUSA is not just “a style”; it is a real, integrated branch of this ecosystem.
Warubi runs a “WARUBI Sports X Athletes USA” college pathway, explicitly marketed as a joint offering. It connects student-athletes with over 20,000 college coaches across NCAA, NAIA, NJCAA, and CCCAA, and it showcases 1,000+ college commitments.

Camps and other pages call AthletesUSA Warubi’s “premium partner” for college soccer, with extra benefits for #teamwarubi players. 
Warubi Sports
Herbert Biste, a Warubi co-founder, is publicly listed as a Partner at Athletes USA, reinforcing that this is a deep, structural relationship, not a loose affiliation. 
LinkedIn
So in the app, AthletesUSA should be treated as Warubi’s dedicated college recruiting engine, not just a third-party tool.
3. 1. FC Köln ITP – elite Bundesliga pathway with official partnership
Warubi is an official partner for 1. FC Köln’s International Talent Program (ITP) and Football School:
FC Köln’s own site lists Warubi Sports and Germany Soccer Academy as core partners that have helped build the long-term Football School program since 2018. 
fc.de
Köln’s International Talent Program (ITP) offers five training sessions per week with UEFA-licensed club coaches, matches, performance testing, match visits, and training observation, with partner agencies covering services like accommodation and visas (Warubi being one of those partners). 
fc.de
+1
Warubi’s site markets the Bundesliga ITP / FC Cologne academy as a high-prestige residential program that integrates selected international players into 1. FC Köln’s training environment and describes it as a trusted filter for both pro contracts and college scholarships. 
Warubi Sports
There is also a Women’s 1. FC Köln ITP pathway promoted by Warubi. 
Warubi Sports
+1
So, in the app, 1. FC Köln ITP should be modeled as a flagship elite program branch that connects to:
Pro trials / representation (for top performers)
AthletesUSA college pathway (for scholarship opportunities)
4. Pro representation cluster – PM Sportmanagement & Karl M. Herzog
On the pro side, Warubi is part of a representation alliance with established German player agencies:
Karl M. Herzog Sportmanagement is a long-running, licensed player agency in Germany with dozens of clients in top tiers. 
Transfermarkt
+1
PM Sportmanagement describes itself on Instagram as a “Full Service Sport Agency in cooperation with: Karl M. Herzog Sportmanagement @warubisports …”, explicitly listing Warubi as a cooperation partner. 
Instagram
Transfermarkt entries show PM Sportmanagement managing professional players in Germany and elsewhere, which illustrates the level at which these partners operate.

So, in the app, Pro Representation should be modeled as:
A long-term CRM-style pipeline (not a short program)
Where Warubi, PM Sportmanagement, and Karl M. Herzog collaborate on scouting, trials, contracts, and career management for selected players
Fed by performance data from ITP, showcases, college, etc.
5. Coaching pathway – TFV & UEFA B/C courses
Warubi also runs a coaching education pathway in cooperation with the Thuringia Football Association (TFV), a regional association within the German FA (DFB).

Key pieces:
Warubi organizes official DFB–UEFA B and C license courses in Germany for non-German/international coaches, taught in English, with limited spots and full board included.

Application forms explicitly reference the TFV Associate Degree (online course via the Warubi Online Academy) and require home-FA approval to join.

Warubi and TFV are jointly mentioned in posts celebrating new groups of international coaches achieving their UEFA B license.

Warubi offers an online “German FA Coaching License – Online Course” that awards a certificate & license from TFV and can give credits toward the in-person DFB/UEFA pathway.

So in the app, the Coaching Pathway should be modeled as:
Online TFV prep course → in-person DFB/UEFA B & C courses in Germany → alumni network and career opportunities
Parallel to the player pathways but sharing some events (e.g., ITP for coaches observing training)
6. Geographic scope – including Lithuania but not limited to it
Warubi’s pathways are international by design:
Application flows for Warubi’s Germany Soccer Academy and AthletesUSA allow players from almost any country, including Lithuania, to apply, showing the global intake.

While I don’t see a specific public “Warubi x Lithuanian FA” contract, it’s accurate that:
Coaches from countries like Lithuania can use Warubi’s TFV/UEFA pathway.
Players and coaches from Lithuania (and many other countries) are part of the broader Warubi + AthletesUSA + ITP ecosystem.
The app should therefore never be hard-coded to one nationality; it must support a truly global user base.
7. How everything connects (conceptual model for the app)
From these sources, the realistic network looks like this:

Player pathway examples
Youth → Warubi camps / Futures → ITP at 1. FC Köln →
→ AthletesUSA for college → later possible Pro Representation with PM/Karl Herzog.
Or: Standout ITP or college players → trials / agents in the PM / Herzog network.
Coach pathway example
Online TFV course → in-person DFB/UEFA B course (Warubi + TFV) →
→ Observation of Bundesliga environments (e.g., ITP / Cologne) → coaching roles.
The app’s job is to make these links visible and manageable.
8. How I want you (Replit AI) to use this understanding
Going forward in this Replit project:
Treat Warubi Sports as the central orchestrator of a network that includes:
AthletesUSA (college pathway branch)
FC Köln / International Talent Program & Football School (Bundesliga development branch)
PM Sportmanagement + Karl M. Herzog Sportmanagement (pro representation branch)
TFV + DFB/UEFA coaching pathway (coach education branch)
When you design data models, flows, or UI:
Distinguish time-bound programs (ITP cohorts, coaching courses, camps)
From continuous pathways (AthletesUSA recruiting, pro representation, coaching careers).
Always remember the global intake (including countries like Lithuania) and the need for:
Unified user profiles
Linked histories across programs and pathways
Clear “next step” suggestions for each user.
For now, do not write code.
Just internalize this ecosystem map so that when I ask you for schemas, APIs, or front-end flows, your suggestions respect:
The real partner structure (AthletesUSA, TFV, 1. FC Köln, PM, Karl Herzog)
The difference between programs vs. ongoing representation/recruitment
The idea that Warubi is a connected global hub, not a single siloed service.
