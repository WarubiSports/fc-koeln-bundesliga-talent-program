Prompt for Replit — Warubi Hub Landing App
Scoring + Buckets + Rating + Tags (Visible to Player), No Program Names
You are my coding assistant inside a Replit project.
I’ve uploaded college-soccer-transfer-engine.zip as a structural reference.
I want to repurpose it into a Warubi Hub landing app for American club players (MLS NEXT, ECNL, PPL, GA, USL Academy, etc.) where:
Players go through an evaluation intake flow
The system computes Score, Bucket, Rating, and Tags
These are shown to the player
But we do not mention specific Warubi programs or pathways (no ITP, AthletesUSA, Futures, “pro rep”, etc.)
The final CTA is to join a free Warubi platform account
Think: neutral evaluation product that leads into a free player platform.
1. Evaluation Flow (Multi-step Form)
Use the existing transfer-engine project for layout/flow, but replace its fields with the ones below.
Step 1 – Basic Info
Full name
Email (player or parent)
Year of birth / grad year
Primary position(s)
Secondary position(s)
Dominant foot
Step 2 – Club & League Context
Current club
Current league (dropdown):
MLS NEXT
ECNL
PPL
GA
USL Academy
E64
NPL
UPSL Youth
Other (free text)
Age group (U13–U19)
State/Region
Step 3 – Playing Profile
(Updated: no self-evals, physical data required.)
Height (required)
Weight (required)
Primary strengths (text or tags)
Areas to improve (text or tags)
Step 4 – Experience & Stats
(Include match stats.)
Years at current level
Previous clubs/academies
Season stats:
Appearances
Starts
Goals
Assists
Notable achievements (ODP, state/regional/national teams, major tournaments, etc.)
Any national team or pro academy experience (yes/no + details)
Step 5 – Aspirations & Context
Main goals (multi-select):
Play college soccer
Train/compete abroad
Long-term pro ambitions
Improve within current youth level
Preferred “future region”:
USA only
USA & Europe
Europe preferred
Open
When they feel ready for a next step:
6–12 months
1–2 years
2+ years
Step 6 – Media & Contact
Highlight video link (required)
Full game links (optional)
Consent checkbox to be contacted
Persist all data in the backend using the project’s stack (TypeScript + whatever ORM is in place).
2. Internal Evaluation Engine (Now Also User-Facing)
Re-use the idea of the “engine” from college-soccer-transfer-engine, but adapt:
A. Score (numeric)
Compute a numeric score based on inputs such as:
League level (MLS NEXT > ECNL > others)
Age vs. level
Stats (apps/starts/goals/assists)
Achievements
Aspirations (e.g., pro ambitions at older ages might impact score)
You don’t need a perfect model — just a clean, configurable scoring function.
B. Bucket (segment / tier label)
Map the score into named buckets, for example:
Bucket A: Advanced competitive profile
Bucket B: Strong developing profile
Bucket C: Solid foundational profile
Bucket D: Early-stage / emerging profile
C. Rating (simple display label)
A short, user-friendly rating string (1–3 words), e.g.:
“Advanced Level”
“Competitive Level”
“Developing Level”
“Emerging Level”
D. Tags (generated labels)
Generate a set of short tags from the data & result, such as:
“Attacking Midfielder”
“High Output Goal Scorer”
“Two-Way Fullback”
“Physically Strong”
“Technical Profile”
“Early Stage Prospect”
Tags are descriptive, not promises.
3. Result Page (Visible to Player)
On submission, the user should see a Profile Summary with:
Their Score (numeric or scaled, e.g. /100)
Their Bucket (Tier/Group label)
Their Rating (short phrase)
Key Tags (chips/pills)
Plus:
A recap of key inputs (position, league, stats, etc.)
Some neutral, encouraging explanatory text, e.g.:
“This is an initial, automated evaluation based on the information you submitted.”
“Use this as a starting point to understand how your current profile looks on paper.”
“Coaches and scouts always look beyond numbers, but this helps you benchmark things.”
Important:
Do not mention specific Warubi programs, offers, or outcomes.
No talk of “you should join X program”, “you qualify for Y”, etc.
CTA
After the summary and explanation, show a primary button:
“Create your free Warubi player account”
Clicking this should lead to signup/login for a free Warubi platform (even if it’s only a stub for now).
4. Admin / Staff View
Create an internal view where Warubi staff can:
See all submissions
Filter by:
League
Age group
Region
Score range
Bucket
View:
Raw intake data
Score
Bucket
Rating
Tags
This allows internal routing into the larger ecosystem later (but don’t build that logic yet).
5. Technical Notes
Reuse:
The multi-step wizard from college-soccer-transfer-engine
Form validation patterns
Result-page layout ideas
Replace:
Transfer-portal-specific copy & fields
College-transfer–centric scoring
With:
US youth club evaluation fields listed above
New scoring/bucket logic
Neutral, program-free summary + CTA to free platform
The final UX should feel like:
A professional, transparent evaluation tool for MLS NEXT / ECNL / PPL players that shows them a Score, Bucket, Rating, and Tags — then invites them to create a free Warubi account.
First, design the data model, scoring function structure, and React component layout.
Then, when asked, implement the code.
