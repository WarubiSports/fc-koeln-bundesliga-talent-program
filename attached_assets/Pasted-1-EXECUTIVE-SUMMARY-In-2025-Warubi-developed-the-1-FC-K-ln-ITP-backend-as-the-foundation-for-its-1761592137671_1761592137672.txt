1.⁠ ⁠EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In 2025, Warubi developed the 1.FC Köln ITP backend as the foundation for its digital infrastructure.
What began as a single-app backend has now evolved into a multi-app platform capable of hosting multiple Warubi and partner applications within a single, secure, and scalable environment.
This marks Warubi’s transition from individual project development to operating a unified, technology-driven platform — a key strategic milestone for the organization.

	2.	TECHNICAL EVOLUTION
•⁠  ⁠Initial Build (Early 2025): The 1.FC Köln ITP backend was developed using Express, TypeScript and PostgreSQL as a stand-alone application.
•⁠  ⁠Infrastructure Maturity: A complete Replit → GitHub → Railway pipeline was implemented for continuous integration and automatic deployment; environments are now consistent across development and production.
•⁠  ⁠Multi-App Architecture: An “apps” table and app-key system were added, providing secure isolation between multiple applications through API-key authentication, origin controls and rate limits.
•⁠  ⁠Shared Schema via Drizzle ORM: A central database schema supports multiple apps through versioned migrations, simplifying data management and consistency.
•⁠  ⁠Reproducible Setup: Environment templates, setup scripts and seed commands enable rapid provisioning of new applications or environments within minutes.

	3.	CAPABILITIES
•⁠  ⁠Multi-App Hosting: One backend now supports apps such as 1.FC Köln ITP, AthletesUSA and Coaching Course concurrently.
•⁠  ⁠Security & Isolation: Each app operates with its own API key, origin restrictions, and optional data segregation.
•⁠  ⁠Rapid Deployment: New apps can be created and deployed in hours, not weeks.
•⁠  ⁠Internal + External Use: The same backend runs internal Warubi tools and customer-facing apps seamlessly.

	4.	BUSINESS IMPACT
Development Efficiency: 80–90% faster launch cycles for new apps, estimated €100,000 – €200,000 annual savings.
Scalability: Enables multiple digital products on one platform, adding €150,000 – €250,000 in value.
Strategic IP Ownership: Proprietary multi-tenant technology unique in sports-tech, worth an additional €150,000 – €350,000 in intangible value.
Total Internal Business Value: Combined technical and strategic contribution estimated between €400,000 – €800,000.

	5.	STRATEGIC POSITIONING
The Warubi Platform now acts as a core digital engine powering:
– Talent and performance programs (e.g. 1.FC Köln ITP)
– Recruitment and education products (e.g. AthletesUSA, Coaching Course)
– Warubi’s internal dashboards and management tools
This unified architecture transforms Warubi into a tech-enabled sports organization with a durable competitive advantage and higher enterprise valuation potential.

	6.	NEXT STEPS
	7.	Finalize documentation and tag the stable release (v1.0).
	8.	Begin UI development for the first new app.
	9.	Implement admin dashboard for managing all registered apps.
	10.	Extend shared services (analytics, payments, notifications).

CONCLUSION
The platform built in 2025 around the 1.FC Köln ITP project has become a production-ready multi-tenant backend comparable in maturity to early SaaS infrastructures.
It positions Warubi for long-term growth, efficiency, and innovation — evolving the company from an agency managing digital projects to a technology platform powering a scalable sports-tech ecosystem.
