# POST-ROLLBACK SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS AFTER ROLLBACK

1. **Restore Prevention System:**
   ```bash
   cp AUTH_PROTECTION_PERMANENT.md AUTHENTICATION_PROTECTION_SYSTEM.md
   cp FEATURE_VERIFICATION_PERMANENT.js feature-verification-checklist.js
   cp SAFE_BACKUP_PERMANENT.js safe-backup-system.js
   ```

2. **Verify Application Completeness:**
   ```bash
   node feature-verification-checklist.js
   ```

3. **Create First Safe Backup:**
   ```bash
   node safe-backup-system.js backup
   ```

## PROTECTION PROTOCOL ACTIVE
- No authentication changes without complete feature verification
- Mandatory safe backup before any modifications
- Emergency restoration available from verified backups

## NEXT STEPS
1. Test that all features work (food orders, communications, calendar)
2. Only then proceed with authentication fixes using the safe protocol
3. Always verify features before and after any changes

This prevents the recurring cycle of losing features during authentication fixes.
