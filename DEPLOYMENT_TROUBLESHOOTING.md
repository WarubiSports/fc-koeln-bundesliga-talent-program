# FC KÃ¶ln Management System - Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue
Deployment shows "Internal Server Error" despite working locally.

## Things You Can Try:

### 1. Check Deployment Logs
- In your Replit, go to the "Tools" panel
- Look for "Deployments" or "Console" 
- Check for any error messages during the build/start process
- Look for specific error details that might give us clues

### 2. Manual Deployment Check
- Try running these commands in your Shell:
```bash
cd /home/runner/koln-talent-tracker-maxbisinger
node index.js
```
- See if any errors appear when running manually

### 3. Environment Variables
- Check if there are required environment variables missing
- In Replit, go to "Secrets" tab and ensure SENDGRID_API_KEY is set (if needed)
- Verify DATABASE_URL is properly configured

### 4. Port Configuration
- The deployment might be expecting a different port
- Try accessing: https://koln-talent-tracker-maxbisinger.replit.app:80
- Or try: https://koln-talent-tracker-maxbisinger.replit.app:3000

### 5. Alternative Deployment Method
- Try using Replit's "Run" button instead of "Deploy"
- This uses the development server which we know works

### 6. Check Replit Status
- Visit https://status.replit.com to see if there are any platform issues
- Sometimes deployment services have temporary outages

### 7. Browser Cache
- Try opening the deployment URL in an incognito/private window
- Clear your browser cache and try again

### 8. Contact Replit Support
If none of the above works, you can:
- Contact Replit support directly
- Mention that local development works but deployment fails
- Reference this specific project: koln-talent-tracker-maxbisinger

## What to Look For
When checking logs or errors, look for:
- "EADDRINUSE" (port conflicts)
- "Module not found" (dependency issues) 
- "Permission denied" (file access issues)
- Any specific Node.js error messages

## Next Steps
Once you find specific error messages, I can help fix the exact issue rather than guessing at the problem.
