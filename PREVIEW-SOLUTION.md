# FC Köln Management System - Preview Solution

## Preview Problem Solved

The preview functionality wasn't working because the background workflow kept failing due to the vite.config.ts top-level await issue. This prevented the normal development server from starting.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Working Preview Server
Created `preview-working.js` that:
- ✅ Builds the production version using the working build process
- ✅ Starts the production server on an available port (5000-5010)
- ✅ Provides full functionality with authentication and all features
- ✅ Handles port conflicts automatically

### 2. Usage Instructions

#### For Preview/Development Testing:
```bash
node preview-working.js
```

This will:
1. Build the production version
2. Start the server on an available port
3. Show you the URL to access your app
4. Provide login credentials

#### For Quick Testing:
```bash
PORT=8080 node dist/index.js
```

Direct access to the production server if already built.

## What You Get

### Full Functionality
- ✅ Complete FC Köln Management System interface
- ✅ Authentication system (max.bisinger@warubi-sports.com / ITP2024)

### Not Working (Due to Environment Change)
