# FC Köln Talent Program - Login Landing Page Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Reference-Based Strategy**: Drawing inspiration from premium sports brands (Nike, Adidas athlete portals) combined with modern SaaS authentication pages (Linear, Notion). This creates a professional, aspirational experience that honors the club's prestige while maintaining usability for players and staff.

**Core Principle**: Single-purpose intensity - this page has one job (secure login) delivered with maximum brand impact and zero distractions.
