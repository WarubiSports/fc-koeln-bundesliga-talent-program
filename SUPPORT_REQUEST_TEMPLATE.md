## FC Köln Management System Deployment Issue

### Issue Summary
Persistent deployment failures for a working Node.js application that functions perfectly in development preview but fails in production deployment.

### Project Details
- **Project Name:** koln-talent-tracker-maxbisinger
- **Replit URL:** https://replit.com/@maxbisinger/koln-talent-tracker-maxbisinger
- **Deployment URL:** https://koln-talent-tracker-maxbisinger.replit.app/
- **Issue Type:** Deployment Infrastructure Problem

### Problem Description
The application works flawlessly in development preview with full functionality, but every deployment attempt results in either:
1. "Internal Server Error" (most common)
2. "The deployment could not be reached"

### Technical Details
- **Development Status:** ✅ Fully functional with comprehensive features
- **Preview URL:** Works perfectly with authentication and all 7 system sections
- **Node.js Version:** 20.19.3
- **Dependencies Tried:** Express, zero-dependency Node.js HTTP server, static HTML
- **Error Pattern:** Consistent across multiple deployment approaches

### Deployment Attempts Made
1. **Express-based application** → "Cannot find module 'express'" in deployment environment
2. **Zero-dependency Node.js HTTP server** → "Internal Server Error"
3. **Static HTML fallback** → "Internal Server Error"
4. **Multiple port configurations** → Same errors persist
5. **Cleaned all dist folders and dependencies** → No improvement

### Error Logs Evidence
Deployment logs consistently show:
```
Error: Cannot find module 'express'
code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND'
```
Even when Express was removed and replaced with Node.js built-in modules.

### What Works
- Development preview at port 5000: Full FC Köln management system
- Authentication: max.bisinger@warubi-sports.com / ITP2024
- All features: Player management, calendar, communications, etc.
- Local testing of simplified deployment files

### Request
Please investigate why the deployment environment cannot run even the simplest Node.js HTTP server that works perfectly in development. This appears to be an infrastructure issue with the deployment platform rather than application code problems.

### User Information
- **Account:** max.bisinger@warubi-sports.com
- **Project Value:** Professional sports management system for 1.FC Köln
- **Urgency:** High - System is complete but cannot be deployed

### Additional Context
This is a comprehensive sports talent management platform that needs to be accessible to FC Köln staff and players. The development version has all required features working, but deployment failure prevents production use.
